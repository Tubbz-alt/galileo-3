# Galileo

Android library that helps you to debug applications directly from your android device. Just shake your device to get Galileo to work for you!

By default, Galileo shows three features: SharedPreferences edition, logcat analysis and network requests tracking. Besides that, it allows you to dump the state of your application to a txt file.

## Usage

It is as easy as adding this line to your onCreate Application method. In kotlin:

```kotlin
Galileo(this)
```

Or Java:

```java
new Galileo(this);
```

If you want to track your network requests you must add GalileoInterceptor to your OkHttpClient.

```kotlin
OkHttpClient.Builder()
            .addInterceptor(Galileo.interceptor)
            .build()
```

Galileo supports OkHttp versions 2.X.X and 3.X.X. In order to use it with OkHttp version 2.X.X just add this:
```kotlin
OkHttpClient.Builder()
            .addInterceptor(Galileo.interceptorOld)
            .build()
```

## Plugins

### Preferator

An adaptation from [Preferator] which shows all app preferences files and allows you to edit or delete them.

Be careful with changing third-parties preferences. Some well known third-party libraries won't be shown by default in order to avoid undesired behaviours. You can find them [here] 

Feel free to open a PR to add yours ðŸ˜„

Thanks to [Sloy] for Preferator lib!!

### Lynx

A wrapper for [Lynx] which shows your adb traces. Lynx is a well-known library in Android world that allows you to filter by TraceLevel and/or by a custom text.

Thanks to [pedrovgs] for Lynx lib!!

### Chuck

An adaptation from [Chuck] which shows your HTTP requests and responses. With chuck you can track your network requests, see your backend responses and generate a share info text from request and response, or generate a curl command from that request.

Thanks to [jgilfelt] for Chuck lib!!

## Snapshot file
Galileo allows you to generate a snapshot file with your application state. This txt file could be sent by email to you or your teammates.

This file is something like this:

```text
